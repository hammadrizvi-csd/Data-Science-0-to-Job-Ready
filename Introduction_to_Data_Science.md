## 🏗️ THE CORE PILLARS
Data Science is not just about coding; it is the intersection of three major fields:

1. **COMPUTER SCIENCE** 💻
   - Used for data processing, coding algorithms (Java/Python), and managing databases.
2. **MATHEMATICS & STATISTICS** 📈
   - The backbone! Used for building models, validating data, and finding patterns.
3. **DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE** 🧠
   - Understanding the specific industry (Finance, Healthcare, etc.) to ask the right questions.

## 🔄 THE DATA SCIENCE LIFECYCLE
Below are the mandatory steps for any data-driven project:

### 📥 1. DATA ACQUISITION
Gathering information from APIs, SQL databases, or Web Scraping.

### 🧹 2. DATA CLEANING (Wrangling)
The most important part! Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and fixing errors.

### 🔍 3. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
Using visual charts to find hidden trends before applying any algorithms.

### 🤖 4. MACHINE LEARNING MODELING
Training algorithms to predict future outcomes based on historical data.

### 📢 5. DATA VISUALIZATION
Presenting the final results using tools like PowerBI, Tableau, or Matplotlib.
